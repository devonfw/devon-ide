This is the directory for your workspaces. Each workspace is a sub-folder in this directory that contains your IDE configuration. Further, you typically checkout your projects in the workspace (clone in case of git).
There is always one default workspace called `main`. You may do all your work inside the `main` folder.
However, you can also create additional workspaces according to your personal needs and taste.
E.g. if you are working with forks on github, gitlab, or bitbucket, you may also want to have the original repository cloned in a workspace called `stable` from where you want to create official releases. The same may also apply if you are dealing with maintenance branches (but you are also free to `switch` forth and back with git).

To create a new workspace you only need to create a new, empty subfolder inside this `workspaces` directory.
If you are inside this folder, you can simply start your IDE for that workspace (e.g. `devon eclipse`) and even create a start-script for simplicity (e.g. `devon eclipse create-script`). Feel free to clone projects into that new folder and import them into your IDE to get started.

Please note, that the workspace name is also visible in the title-bar of Eclipse so you get orientation when
you have multiple instances of eclipse running simultaneously.

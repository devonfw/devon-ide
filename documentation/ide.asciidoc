= ide

The `ide` commandlet manages your `devon-ide`.

== setup
Run `devon ide setup` to initially setup your `devon-ide`. The `setup` script in the toplevel directory (`$DEVON_IDE_HOME`) is technically just a shortcut to run this command. The setup only needs to be called once after a new `devon-ide` instance has been created. It will do the following things:

* link:setup#install[install] the `devon` command on your system (if not already installed).
* install all required tools from `DEVON_IDE_TOOLS` link:variables[variable] (if not already installed).
* configure all these tools

== update
Run `devon ide update` to update your `devon-ide`. This will check for updates and link:setup#install[install] them automatically.

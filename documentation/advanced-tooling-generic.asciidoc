== Cross-Plattform Tooling

=== Git Client
If you are looking for a git client that works cross-platform we recommend to use https://git-fork.com/[Fork].

=== Browser Plugins
There are tons of helpful browser plugins out there and it might be a matter of personal taste what you like to have installed. However, as we are heavily using github we want to promote https://github.com/buunguyen/octotree#octotree[octotree].
In case you also work with ZenHub you might want to install the https://www.zenhub.com/extension[Zenhub Browser Extension].

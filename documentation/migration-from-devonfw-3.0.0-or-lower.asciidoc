= Migration from oasp4j-ide

The `devon-ide` is a completely new and innovative solution for managing the local development environment that has been created from scratch.
Releases of https://github.com/oasp/[OASP] as well as releases of https://github.com/devonfw[devonfw] until version 3.0.x are based on the old `oasp4j-ide` that is now considered deprecated. As `devon-ide` is a complete redesign this will have some impact for the users. This section should help and assist so you do not get lost.

== Get familiar with devon-ide

First of all you should roughly get familiar with the new `devon-ide`. The key features and changes are:

* platform-agnostic (supports Windows, Mac, and Linux in a single distribution)
* small core (reduced the download package from ~2 gigabyte to ~2 megebyte)
* fast and easy updates (build in update support)
* minimum number of scripts (removed tons of end-user scripts making things much simpler)
* fully automated setup (run `setup` script and you are ready - even for advanced features that had to be configured manually before)
* single command for everything (entire CLI available via new `devon` command)

For all the details you should study the documentation starting from the link:Home.asciidoc[beginning].

== Migration of existing oasp4j-ide installation

TODO

* extract new `link:scripts.asciidoc[devon-ide-scripts]` on top of your existing installation
* run `setup`
* done

If you get errors:

* ask your technical lead to fix the `links:settings.asciidoc[settings]` git repo for `devon-ide` or offer him to do it for you.
* you need to merge the `https://github.com/devonfw/devon-ide-settings/tree/master/devon[devon]` folder into your settings
* you need to merge the `https://github.com/devonfw/devon-ide-settings/blob/master/devon.properties[devon.properties]` into your settings
* you should check your `variables[-customized][.bat]` and merge required customizations into the proper link:configuration.asciidoc[configuration]
* TODO: It would indeed make sense to support this migration with (partial) automatic scripts

== Hints for users after migration

Getting used to all the new commands might be tedious when starting after a migration.

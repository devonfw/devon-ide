= yarn

The `yarn` commandlet allows to install, configure, and launch https://www.npmjs.com/[npm]. Calling `devon yarn «args»` is more or less the same as calling `yarn «args»` but with the benefit that the version of npm preferred by your project is used (and will be installed if not yet available).

The arguments (`devon yarn «args»`) are explained by the following table:

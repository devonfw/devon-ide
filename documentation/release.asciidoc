= release

Create a release in a standardized way including the following steps:

* verify the current project (no local changes, etc.)
* determine `«version»` (if currently `«version»-SNAPSHOT`) and print out release information.
* ask user for confirmation
* bump release to `«version»` in build configuration (e.g. `pom.xml` files)
* commit the change
* create annotated tag for your release as `release/«version»`
* invoke deployment on build-system
* set next version as `(«version»+1)-SNAPSHOT` in build configuration (e.g. `pom.xml` files)
* commit the change
* push your changes

= kubernetes

The `kubernetes` commandlet allows to install https://kubernetes.io/[kubernetes]. This command is implemented to currently work on Windows. Other OS are not supported yet. 

.Usage of `devon kubernetes`

On Windows

* Checks whether https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10[Windows Subsystem for Linux(WSL)] has been enabled and any linux distribution has been installed.

* If yes, checks whether Kubernetes has already been installed either on Windows or on WSL.

* If yes, program quits since Kubernetes is already available.

* If not, this will install Kubernetes on WSL along with https://k3d.io[K3D] 

* As part of the setup, K3D will create a cluster with a single node with a default name as "devonfw-cluster"

The arguments (`devon kubernetes «args»`) are explained by the following table:

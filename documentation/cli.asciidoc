= Devon CLI

The `devon-ide` is shipped with a central command `devon`. The link:setup.asciidoc[setup] will automatically register this command so it is available in any shell on your system. This page describes the Command Line Interface (CLI) of this command.

== Devon
Without any arguments the `devon` command will determine your `DEVON_IDE_HOME` and setup your link:variables.asciidoc[environment variables] automatically. In case you are not inside of a `devon-ide` folder the command will echo a message and do nothing.

[source,bash]
--------
[/]$ devon
You are not inside a devon IDE installation: /
[/]$ cd /projects/my-project/workspaces/test/my-git-repo
[my-git-repo]$ devon
devon-ide has environment variables have been set for /projects/my-project in workspace main
[my-git-repo]$ echo $DEVON_IDE_HOME
/projects/devon
[my-git-repo]$ echo $JAVA_HOME
/projects/my-project/software/java
--------

== Commandlets
The `devon` command supports a plugable set of _commandlets_. Such commandlet is provided as first argument to the devon command and my take additional arguments:

`devon «commandlet» [«arg»]*`

Technically a commandlet is a bash script located in `$DEVON_IDE_HOME/scripts/command`. So if you want to integrate another tool with `devon-ide` we are awaiting your pull-request.

The following commandlets are currently available:

* link:build.asciidoc[build]

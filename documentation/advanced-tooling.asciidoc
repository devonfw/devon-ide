= Tools

This page is a general guide and collection to boost your productivity by using proper tools.

.Tabs in Firefox

This nice feature can be added to many other tools.

See link:guide-integration.asciidoc[] for integration of ConEmu with `devon-ide`.

== Browser Plugins
There are tons of helpful browser plugins out there and it might be a matter of personal taste what you like to have installed. However, as we are heavily using github we want to promote https://github.com/buunguyen/octotree#octotree[octotree].

== Windows Helpers

=== Handle passwords
For security you want complex passwords that differ for each account? For simplicity you only want to remember a single password? Want to have both? Then you need to install https://keepass.info/[KeePass] right now.

=== Real text editor
A real developer needs a real text editor and not windows build in `notepad`.
The most common choice is https://notepad-plus-plus.org/[Notepad++].

=== Real compression tool
You need to deal with ZIP files, TGZ, dpkg, etc.? Just install http://www.7-zip.org/[7zip] and forget about windows build-in ZIP support (that is buggy with long file paths, etc.).

=== Smarter clipboard
You want to paste something from the clipboard but meanwhile you had to copy something else? Just one of many things you can easily do with http://ditto-cp.sourceforge.net/[ditto].

=== Sysinternals Tools
A real developer will quickly notice that windows build in tools to analyze processes, network connections, autostarts, etc. are quite poor. So what you really want is the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysinternals-suite[Sysinternals-Suite]. Make process-explorer your https://www.ricksdailytips.com/make-process-explorer-default-task-manager/[default task manager] asap. Use autoruns to prevent nasty backround things to be started automatically. Use tcpview to figure out which process is blocking port 8080, etc.

=== Cope with file locks
Did you ever fail to delete a file or directory that was locked by some process and you did not even know which one it was?
Then you might love https://www.iobit.com/en/iobit-unlocker.php[IoBit Unlocker].
See also https://www.howtogeek.com/128680/HOW-TO-DELETE-MOVE-OR-RENAME-LOCKED-FILES-IN-WINDOWS/[this article].

=== Create symbolic links
You are used to symbolic and hard links in Linux? You have to work with Windows? You would also like to have such links in Windows? Why not? Windows https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/16226/complete-guide-to-symbolic-links-symlinks-on-windows-or-linux/[supports real links] (not these stupid shortcuts).
If you even want to have it integrated in windows explorer you might want to install http://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/linkshellextension.html[linkshellextension]. However, you might want to disable `SmartMove` in the http://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/hardlinkshellext.html#configuration[configuration] if you face strange performance issues when moving folders.

=== Linux
Install https://www.cygwin.com/[Cygwin] and get your bash in windows with ssh-agent, awk, sed, tar, and all the tools you love (or hate).

=== X11
Want to connect via SSH and need to open an X11 app from the server? Want to see the GUI on your windows desktop?
No problem: Install https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/[VcXsrv].

=== Keyboard Freak
Are you the keyboard shortcut guy? Want to have shortcuts for things like « and » ?
Then you should try https://www.autohotkey.com/[AutoHotKey].
For the example (« and ») you can simply use this script to get started:
```
^<::Send {U+00AB}
^+<::Send {U+00BB}
```
Now just press `[ctrl][<]` and `[ctrl][>]` (`[ctrl][shift][<]`). Next create shortcuts to launch your IDE, to open your favorite tool, etc.

=== Paint anywhere on your desktop
Do you collaborate sharing your screen, and want to mark a spot on top of what you see? Use http://epic-pen.com/[Epic Pen] to do just that.

=== analyze graphs
Need to visualise complex graph structures? Convert them to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_Graph_Format[Trivial Graph Format] (.tgf) an run https://www.yworks.com/products/yed[yEd] to get an interactive visualization of your graph.

=== up your screen capture game
Capture any part of your screen with a single click, directly upload to dropbox, or run an svn commit (oops sorry git ;-) ) all in one go with http://getgreenshot.org/[Greenshot].

=== Fast Search in Windows
https://voidtools.com/[Everything] is a desktop search utility for Windows that can rapidly find files and folders by name.

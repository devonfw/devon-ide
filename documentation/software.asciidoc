= software

The `software` folder contains the third party tools for your IDE such as link:mvn.asciidoc[maven], link:npm.asciidoc[npm], link:java.asciidoc[java], etc. With respect to the link:license.asciidoc[licensing terms] you may create a custom archive containing a `devon-ide` together with the required software. However, to be platform indepentent and allow lightweight updates the `devon-ide` is capable to download and link:install.asciidoc[install] the software automatically for you.

== repository

By default software is downloaded via the internet from public download URLs of the according tools. However, some projects may need specific tools or tool versions that are not publically available.
In such case, they can create their own software repository (e.g. in a VPN) and link:configuration.asciidoc[configure] the base URL of it via `DEVON_SOFTWARE_REPOSITORY` link:variables.asciidoc[variable].
Then `devon-ide` will download all software from this repository only instead of the default public download URLs.
This repository (URL) should be accessible within your network via HTTPS (or HTTP) and without any authentication.
The repository needs to have the following structure:
```
${DEVON_SOFTWARE_REPOSITORY}/«tool»/«version»/«tool»-«version»-«os».tar.gz
```
So for every tool `«tool»` (link:java.asciidoc[java], link:mvn.asciidoc[maven], link:vscode.asciidoc[vscode], link:eclipse.asciidoc[eclipse], etc.) you need to provide a folder in your repository.
Within this folder for every supported version `«version»` you need a subfolder.
This subfolder needs to contain the tool in that version for every operating system `«os»` (`windows`, `linux`, or `mac`).

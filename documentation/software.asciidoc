= software

The `software` folder contains the third party tools for your IDE such as link:mvn.asciidoc[maven], link:npm.asciidoc[npm], link:java.asciidoc[java], etc. With respect to the link:license.asciidoc[licensing terms] you may create a custom archive containing a `devon-ide` together with the required software. However, to be platform indepentent and allow lightweight updates the `devon-ide` is capable to download and link:install.asciidoc[install] the software automatically for you.

== Project import

The devonfw IDE supports to automatically checkout and import of required projects into your IDE during setup via link:ide.asciidoc[ide command]  . To configure this you put properties file in to the `projects/` sub-folder in your `ide-settings`. Each file descripes one "project" which you like to checkout and import:

----
path=myproject
workingsets=Set1,Set2
workspace=example
git.url=http://github.com/someorg/someproject
git.branch=develop
eclipse=import
----

Please not that the "property"-file is parsed via shell and not via java. So be careful with "advanced" features property-files normally support.

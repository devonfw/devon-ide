The `.m2` folder is used for configurations of link:mvn[maven]. It contains the local `repository` folder used as cache for artifacts downloaded and installed by maven (see also https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-repositories.html[maven repositories]).
Further there are two configuration files for maven:

* https://maven.apache.org/settings.html[settings.xml] initialized from a template from your `devon-ide` xref:settings[]. You may customize this to your needs (configuring HTTP proxies, credentails, or other user-specific settings).
* https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html[settings-security.xml] is auto-generated for you by `devon-ide` with a random password. This should make it easier for `devon-ide` users to use https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html[password encryption] and never add passwords in plain text for better security.

Finally there is a file `variables` for the user-specific link:configuration[] of `devon-ide`.

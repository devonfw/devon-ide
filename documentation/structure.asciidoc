== TERMS_OF_USE
You need to agree with the https://github.com/devonfw/ide/blob/master/TERMS_OF_USE.adoc[TERMS_OF_USE] in order to use `devonfw-ide`. Everything included out of the box applies to open-source licenses. However, due to the many third party components with their licenses and terms we want to make this clear to all our users and be compliant.
